# 🏥 Personalized Safety Checking - MedSafe Assistant

## 🎯 Overview

The MedSafe Assistant chatbot now includes **personalized safety checking** that analyzes medications against the patient's specific medical profile BEFORE providing general information.

---

## ✨ How It Works

### **Three-Layer Safety Check:**

```
Patient asks about a medication
         ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Check Patient's ALLERGIES    │ → Critical alerts if match found
└──────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ 2. Check Patient's CONDITIONS   │ → Warnings for contraindications
└──────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ 3. Check CURRENT MEDICATIONS     │ → Drug interaction warnings
└──────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
Show personalized warnings FIRST
Then show general drug information
```

## 🔍 What Gets Checked

### **1. Allergy Detection**

The system checks for:
- **Direct allergies**: Patient allergic to "Penicillin" → Warns against Augmentin
- **Cross-allergies**: Patient allergic to "Penicillin" → Warns against Amoxicillin
- **Component matching**: Partial name matching for safety

**Example:**
```
Patient Profile:
- Allergies: Penicillin

Patient asks: "Can I take Augmentin?"

Response:
🏥 PERSONALIZED SAFETY CHECK FOR YOU:

⛔ CROSS-ALLERGY WARNING: Augmentin contains penicillin-type 
antibiotic. You are allergic to Penicillin!
DO NOT TAKE. Contact your doctor for an alternative.
```

### **2. Condition-Based Warnings**

The system checks patient conditions against drug contraindications:

| Condition | Drug Type | Warning |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Hypertension** | NSAIDs (Brufen, Ibuprofen) | May increase blood pressure |
| **Diabetes** | Steroids (Prednisolone) | Can increase blood sugar |
| **Kidney Disease** | Many drugs | Requires dosage adjustment |
| **Heart Disease** | NSAIDs, some drugs | May increase cardiovascular risk |
| **Asthma** | Aspirin, Disprin | May trigger asthma attacks |
| **Gastric Ulcer** | NSAIDs, Aspirin | Can worsen ulcers, cause bleeding |

**Example:**
```
Patient Profile:
- Conditions: Hypertension, Type 2 Diabetes

Patient asks: "Can I take Brufen?"

Response:
🏥 PERSONALIZED SAFETY CHECK FOR YOU:

⚠️ CAUTION: You have Hypertension. Brufen (NSAID) may 
increase blood pressure.
Consult your doctor. Consider Paracetamol as a safer alternative.

---

📋 Brufen (Ibuprofen)
💊 Dosage: 200mg-400mg
...
```

### **3. Drug Interaction Checking**

The system checks against current medications:

**Critical Interactions Detected:**
- Warfarin + Aspirin/Ibuprofen → Bleeding risk
- Multiple drugs affecting same system

**Example:**
```
Patient Profile:
- Current Medications: Lisinopril (for blood pressure)

Patient asks: "Can I take Brufen for pain?"

Response:
🏥 PERSONALIZED SAFETY CHECK FOR YOU:

⚠️ DRUG INTERACTION: Brufen may interact with your 
current medication Lisinopril.
Consult your doctor or pharmacist before combining 
these medications.
```

## 🚨 Warning Levels

### **Critical (⛔)**
- **Allergies**: Direct allergy match
- **Cross-allergies**: Related drug classes
- **Severe interactions**: Life-threatening combinations

**Action:** DO NOT TAKE - Contact doctor immediately

### **Warning (⚠️)**

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Data Flow:**

```javascript
// 1. Patient data passed from PatientDashboard
<MedSafeAssistant
  patientData={currentPatient}  // Includes allergies, conditions, meds
  patientName={patientName}
/>

// 2. Safety check function
const checkPatientSafety = (drug) => {
  // Check allergies
  // Check conditions
  // Check drug interactions
  return { safe: boolean, warnings: [] }
}

// 3. Format response with safety warnings first
const formatDrugInfo = (drug, query) => {
  const safetyCheck = checkPatientSafety(drug);
  
  let safetySection = '';
  if (safetyCheck.warnings.length > 0) {
    // Show personalized warnings FIRST
  } else {
    // Show "all clear" message
  }
  
  // Then show general drug information
  return safetySection + drugInfo;
}
```

### **Safety Check Logic:**

```javascript
// Allergy checking
allergies.forEach(allergy => {
  if (drug.name.includes(allergy) || 
      drug.genericName.includes(allergy)) {
    warnings.push({ type: 'critical', ... });
  }
  
  // Cross-allergy checking
  if (allergy === 'Penicillin' && 
      drug.genericName.includes('amoxicillin')) {
    warnings.push({ type: 'critical', ... });
  }
});

// Condition checking
conditions.forEach(condition => {
  if (condition.includes('Hypertension') && 
      drug.genericName.includes('ibuprofen')) {
    warnings.push({ type: 'warning', ... });
  }
});

// Drug interaction checking
currentMeds.forEach(med => {
  if (drug.interactions?.includes(med.name)) {
    warnings.push({ type: 'warning', ... });
  }
});
```
