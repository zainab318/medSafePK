# AI Suggestion Box - Testing Guide

## 🧠 Overview

The AI Suggestion Box is an intelligent prescription analysis system that provides:
- **Banned drug alerts** (DRAP regulations)
- **High-risk medication warnings**
- **Dosage corrections** (too high/too low)
- **Safer alternatives** recommendations
- **AI reasoning** for each suggestion

## 🎯 How to Test

### Test Case 1: Banned Drug Alert (CRITICAL)
**Try this drug:** `Nimesulide`
- **Dosage:** `100mg`
- **Frequency:** `Twice daily`

**Expected AI Suggestion:**
- ⛔ DRAP Alert showing drug is banned/restricted
- Reason: "Restricted use due to liver toxicity concerns"
- Alternative: "Paracetamol or Ibuprofen"
- Severity: HIGH

### Test Case 2: High-Risk Drug Warning
**Try this drug:** `Warfarin`
- **Dosage:** `5mg`
- **Frequency:** `Once daily`

**Expected AI Suggestion:**
- ⚠️ High-Risk Medication alert
- Warning: "Requires regular INR monitoring. High bleeding risk."
- Required Monitoring: "Monthly blood tests recommended"
- Severity: HIGH

### Test Case 3: Dosage Too High
**Try this drug:** `Paracetamol`
- **Dosage:** `1500mg` (exceeds max 1000mg)
- **Frequency:** `Three times daily`

**Expected AI Suggestion:**
- 📊 Dosage Alert
- Shows prescribed vs. recommended maximum
- Recommendation: "Consider reducing to 1000mg or lower"
- AI Reasoning about risk of adverse effects

### Test Case 4: Dosage Too Low
**Try this drug:** `Ibuprofen`
- **Dosage:** `100mg` (below min 200mg)
- **Frequency:** `Three times daily`

**Expected AI Suggestion:**
- 📊 Dosage Notice
- Shows prescribed vs. therapeutic range
- Recommendation: "Consider increasing to 200mg for optimal efficacy"

### Test Case 5: Safer Alternative Available
**Try this drug:** `Ibuprofen`
- **Dosage:** `400mg`
- **Frequency:** `Three times daily`

**Expected AI Suggestion:**
- 💡 Safer Alternative Available
- Alternative 1: **Paracetamol** - "Lower GI and cardiovascular risk"
- Alternative 2: **Celecoxib** - "COX-2 selective, lower GI bleeding risk"
- Includes suitability information for each alternative

### Test Case 6: Multiple Issues (Combination Test)
**Try these drugs together:**
1. `Ibuprofen` - `400mg` - `Three times daily`
2. `Lisinopril` - `10mg` - `Once daily`
3. `Paracetamol` - `1200mg` - `Three times daily`

**Expected Results:**
- Drug interaction warning (Ibuprofen + Lisinopril)
- Safer alternative for Ibuprofen
- Dosage alert for Paracetamol (too high)
- Multiple AI suggestions displayed
