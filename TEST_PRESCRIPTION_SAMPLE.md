# 🧪 Test Prescription for OCR

## The Issue with Your Upload

Your OCR **is working correctly!** 

Looking at the raw text extracted:
```
Smile Designing | Teeth Whitenin
Dental Implants Bean THE CH ITE TUSK
2&i Mm
```

This appears to be from a **dental clinic brochure or advertisement**, not a prescription with medicine names. That's why the system correctly shows "No medicines detected."

## 🔍 Why Your Image Didn't Work

The raw OCR text shows:
```
Smile Designing | Teeth Whitenin
Dental Implants Bean THE CH ITE TUSK
```

This is clearly:
❌ A dental clinic advertisement/brochure
❌ Business card text
❌ Marketing material

NOT a prescription with medicine names!

---

## ✅ What the System Looks For

### Medicine Name Patterns:
- Known brands: Panadol, Brufen, Augmentin, etc.
